### ## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your own website or local environment.

#### ### 1. Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A text editor (like VS Code).
- A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

#### ### 2. Installation & Configuration

1.  **Download the Code:**
    Clone or download the repository containing the `index.html` file.

2.  **Add Your API Key:**
    Open the HTML file and find the following line in the `<script>` section:

    ```javascript
    const apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"; // IMPORTANT: Use your actual API key here!
    ```

    Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual Google Gemini API key.

3.  **Customize the Bot's Persona (Optional):**
    Modify the `systemPrompt` constant to define the chatbot's personality, instructions, and domain knowledge.

    ```javascript
    const systemPrompt = `You are a friendly, helpful, and expert AI customer support assistant for "Your Company Name Here"...`;
    ```

#### ### 3. Running the Project

Since this is a self-contained HTML file with no build step, you can simply **open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser**.

For the best experience during development, use a live server extension (like "Live Server" in VS Code) to automatically reload the page when you make changes.

### ## üîß How It Works

The entire logic is contained within the `<script>` tag in the HTML file.

1.  **`initializeChat()`:** This function runs on page load and when the "Clear Chat" button is clicked. It resets the chat history and displays the initial welcome message and suggestion buttons.
2.  **`addMessage(sender, message)`:** This function dynamically creates and appends new message bubbles (either from the 'user' or 'bot') to the chat window.
3.  **`getAIResponse(prompt)`:** This is the core function. It displays a typing indicator, constructs a payload with the current conversation history and system prompt, sends a `POST` request to the Gemini API, and processes the returned response.
